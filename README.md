# Hapi ORM Assignment

Starter code for the assignment.

Questions:
1) How do we post a connection in the joining table?
2) I know for the /patient/{pid}/vaccines/{vid} we have to retrieve those data points. I don't understand how to use it with create and delete

Have Done and Checked with Postman:
* Create: /patient
* Retrieve: /companies
* Retrieve: /patients
* Retrieve: /patients/{id}
* Update: /patients/{id}
* Retrieve: /vaccines


Need to Complete:
* Create: /patient/{pid}/vaccines/{vid}
* Delete: /patient/{pid}/vaccines/{vid}
